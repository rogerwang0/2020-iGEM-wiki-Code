                    <p>During the 4th Southern China Regional Online Meeting, our two teams had a general understanding
                        of each other's projects. Their project is about the prevention of dental caries by killing
                        Streptococcus mutans. They expressed a polymer that can be hydrolyzed by salivary hydrolase to
                        monomer Tachyplesin. We found that both of our teams used antimicrobial peptides and there was
                        an overlap in the screening of antimicrobial peptides, which we used as a breakthrough to carry
                        out a number of exchanges and cooperation.</p>

                    <p>The student leader of the two teams communicated with each other. At first, SZPT-CHINA wanted to
                        use tooth socket as drug carriers to design hardware, but our team felt that braces had
                        shortcomings such as high cost and individual needs to be customized, so we suggested that they
                        could use some more convenient, faster and lower-cost products, such as toothpaste.</p>

                    <p>Shaanxi iGEM Meetup is the first communication meeting we hosted.</p>
                    <p>We specially invited members of our partner SZPT-CHINA to participate in Shaanxi iGEM Meetup and
                        had friendly exchanges with all teams in Shaanxi. After introducing our project, we both had a
                        detailed understanding of each other's projects. They were interested in the broad-spectrum
                        antimicrobial peptides we used. </p>

                    <p> Our team was invited to join the Friend Team Meetup hosted by SZPT-CHINA. In that meetup, we
                        communicated about antimicrobial peptides. We exchanged problems and experience about the
                        selection of antimicrobial peptides and the design of experiments. After that, we got a lot of
                        valuable suggestions.</p>

                    <p>We communicated with each other online, and we provided them with a variety of relevant
                        antimicrobial peptide sequences to help them get the minimum inhibitory concentration of
                        multiple antimicrobial peptides. Finally, they chose to add DCD1L antimicrobial peptides into
                        their experiment.</p>

                    <p>In this online meetup, we mentioned that we lack a suicide switch that prevents bacteria from
                        escaping, and they suggested that a nutrition-hungry suicide switch might meet our needs, and
                        would like to provide us with a mature suicide switch that they used last year. The suicide
                        switch can sense the concentration of glucose in the environment. Glucose starvation activates
                        the catabolic response using cyclic-AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP), one of the best-studied
                        TF’s. Low glucose environments cause the cAMP-CRP complex to bind target DNA and regulate
                        hundreds of gene targets. We used PT-α crp to control the downstream gene. It is sensitive to
                        glucose starvation. When glucose is deficient in the environment, glucose starvation induces the
                        overexpression of autolysin gene in the T-α crp promoter(acmA).</p>

                    <p>We communicated with each other about the progress of the experiment. As a result, we exchanged
                        our protein purification method because we all encountered the problem that the protein could
                        not be purified and the concentration of the purified protein was too low. They recommended us
                        to use the ultrafiltration centrifuge tube for protein purification and concentration. When we
                        took their advice, we made some progress in our experiment.</p>

                        development history, the basic knowledge of synthetic. Besides, we would like to focus on the
                        antibacterial peptide and how to produce antimicrobial peptides by means of synthetic biology.

                    <p>The projects of our two teams have one thing in common.</p>
                    <p>We all hoped to solve the problem of antibiotic resistance by using antimicrobial peptides, and
                        we both used materials that can stick to the surface of the skin.
                        We noticed there was a great potential for cooperation.

                        Online Meeting(CCiC). We learned that their project was to obtain a product that could form a
                        waterproof membrane on the skin surface by using Pichia pastoralis to express sticky protein and
                        tyrosinaseantimicrobial peptides which can kill propionic acid bacteria and express. The product
                        helps prevent acne and can be easily removed by protease hydrolysis, avoiding the pain of direct
                        skin tearing.</p>

                        actively preparing for the construction of the Northwest Part library.</p>

                    <p>Our team has reached cooperation with the XJTU-China team in modeling. Our modelers helped find
                        the parameter data needed by each other's growth and expression equations. We reached a
                        consensus on the application of some formulas, discussed the CA model in depth, and exchanged
                        modeling methods and experience. The XJTU-China team has encountered many problems. The
                        parameters needed during the bottleneck period are difficult to find in the literature. After
                        clarifying the related problems, our team pointed out that it should be combined with
                        experimental data for parameter fitting. At the same time, XJTU-China also solved some of our
                        problems. Our growth model lacks some parameters. The suggestions they gave us revolved around
                        programming and GAN, and we exchanged the PH and soil parameter measurement experience. We are
                        all aware of the importance of querying data, and we are more clear about the direction of
                        modeling.</p>

                    <p>We conducted experimental exchanges, in the course of their experiment, they found that the
                        negative control had a band, we suggested that they use new water, or used new primers, and the
                        primers were packed into small packages. We had trouble in lysing cells, and they suggested that
                        we replace the Bacterial lysis solution. Before: Bacterial lysis solution 1.0: 50mM/L tris-HCl
                        0.5mM /L EDTA 50mM/L NaCl pH=8.0After: Bacterial lysis solution 2.0: 20mM/L tris-HCl 150mM/L
                        NaCl., after changing the bacterial lysis solution, the efficiency of breaking bacteria was
                        improved a lot.</p>

                    <p>We had a modeling exchange meeting once again. NWU-CHINA-A suggested XJTU-China that they can
                        first fit the corresponding parameters, then select the appropriate promoter from the part
                        library to construct the system and optimize the experimental design of the project with dry
                        simulation to solve problem that the parameters of the suicide switch activation mechanism
                        cannot be found. XJTU-China modeling members made suggestions for the simulation process of cell
                        expression products in the NWU-CHINA-A&apos;s modeling.They advised that probability
                        distribution can be used to replace the assumption of uniformity of all cells that make the
                        simulation more realistic and credible. </p>

                    <p>Both teams checked and discussed this year's award criteria, and under the change of this year’s
                        award criteria and the obstruction of the epidemic, we agreed on what should be more important.
                        Both sides had benefited a lot, which is the strength of Shaanxi iGEM team alliance.

                    <p>Finally, our team decided to put Kaia, KaiB and RPAA genes into the part library, and we will use them later.</p>
