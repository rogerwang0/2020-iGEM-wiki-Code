			<h3>Antibiotic Resisitance</h3>
			<p>Since antibiotics were put into use in the early 20th century , they have saved billions of lives
				from lethal infection. Nevertheless, the rising risk of severe side-effects and the potential
				antibiotic resistance limit the usage of antibiotics. According to a 2019 report from US Department
				of Health and Human Services, more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the
				U.S. each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result[1].
			</p>
			<p>Antibiotics resistance has a long history, which is just began short after the commercialization of
				antibiotic. Here is a list of antibiotic resistant germs over time from CDC’s site.</p>

			<span class="model-img-label">The history of antibiotic resisitance[2]</span>


			<p>Antibiotics resistance develops fast. It’s nearly inevitable due to the evolution pressure from the
				application of antibiotics. Among the several ways to tackle the antibiotics resistance, developing
				new drug is the most promising one.</p>

			<h1>Saving Firefighters from Bushfire</h1>
			<p>As a fire-prone state, wildfire has burned 3.9 millions land in California this year, which is the forth
				fire this three years. Across the state, 17,000 firefighters are fighting with nearly 24 fire. Wild
				fires frequently occur in Australia during the hot and dry season. From November 8 last year to February
				13 this year, the fire lasted for four months, which caused at least 33 death, mostly are firefighters,
				and many firefighters from other countries dead. In Liangshan County, Sichuan Province, due to the
				continuous forest fires in the spring of 2019 and 2020, people have endured a lot. To put out the fire,
				we sacrificed 31 firefighters and a large number of personnel. ire leads to plenty of loss and
				casualities all around the world annaully. Firefighters are easier to get burnt or bruised in their
				daily training or working. The risk of infection is high if those wounds are not treated in time. To
				protect our firefighters from lethal bacterial infection, we intend to develop an antibacterial and
				completely biodegradable adhesive bandage.</p>

			<h1 class="sector-title">Our Solution</h1>
			<h3>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)</h3>
			<p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small peptides which are anti-bacterial, anti-viral,
				anti-microbial, anti-protozoal, even anti-cancer. As parts of innate immunity, AMPs are produced
				by all known living species (ranging from bacteria, fungi, and plants to invertebrates,
				non-mammalian vertebrates, and mammals). </p>
			<p>Compared to antibiotics, AMP activity does not lead to a mutation-inducing SOS response which could
				cause
				antibiotics
				resistance.[3] </p>
			<img class="text-img" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/d/d9/T--NWU-CHINA-A--AR_scheme.png">
			<p>What’s more? AMPs also promote tissue healing and exhibit broad spectrum antibacterial activity. Its
				wide
				biological activity displays the bright future in Biomedical Science. Besides, it has low toxicity,
				which shows
				that AMPs have less risks when we use them.</p>

			<h3>Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)</h3>
			<p>Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a diverse biopolyesters synthesized by many bacterial. Besides, PHA
				materials have been produced in large quantity for various application research including medical
				implants for about 30 years. Moreover, common PHA biodegradation products including oligomers and
				monomers are also not toxic to the cells and tissues compatible properties. Importantly, pharmaceutical
				applications of some PHA degradation products also have been reported. As a result, PHA has bright
				application potential in synthetic biology field.</p>
			<h3>Polyhydroxyalkanoates surface binding protein (PhaP)</h3>
			<p>PhaP is an amphiphilic protein which can attach to the surface of PHA particles. It has a hydrophilic
				domain and a hydrophobic domain. The hydrophobic domain can interact with various types of hydrophobic
				surfaces. In that case, if a protein can bind to PhaP, then it can link to hydrophobic surfaces by PHAs
				and PhaP indirectly.</p>
			<p>The method we use to combine PhaP and AMP is a gene-level fusion mediated by a flexible linker peptide.
				The linker with low hydrophobicity and low charge effect can stretch fully to separate the different
				fusion components on both sides, so that PhaP and AMP will fold to their natural conformations without
				interfering with each other. In that case, we can use synthetic biology tool to produce our product.</p>
			<h3>Project Goal</h3>
			<p>In the laboratory, we aimed to prove that the complex expressed by engineering bacteria has
				inhibitory
				effect on Staphylococcus aureus. In the real world, we are going to set up a company to produce our
				products. We are now applying for a patent in these days.</p>

			<h1 class="sector-title">COVID-19 Impact</h1>
			<!--<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused great trouble to our 2020 project since the closure of Wuhan. We're
				unable to get back to school after the spring festival at first. Subsequently, measures like online
				meeting and task allocation were exert to cover the lack of offline activities.</p>
			<p>Several weeks later, 2020 iGEM Jamboree was declared to be a virtual Jamboree, which disappointed
				some of our teammates. As a result, a teammate from computer science college left us. But the others
				persisted in procceeding our project without hesitation. </p>
			<p>The COVID-19 influence us most in the experiment part. Most of our teammates hadn't get back to
				school until the middle of August. Only then can we begin to conduct our experiment. We had to
				compress the time for experiment to ensure the project could be completed before the deadlines.
				These days are hard for us, however, we never thinked of giving up, and we'll pull together to prove
				our work wasn't done in vain.The COVID-19 influence us most in the experiment part. Most of our

				pull together to prove our work wasn't done in vain. </p>-->
			<p>Since the end of 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory
				Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) spread to all world, which made the whole world suffered. The
				epidemic influenced us a lot.</p>
			<p>As for the experiment part of our project, it shortened our experiment time greatly. We were supposed to
				come back to campus in February 9th, 2020 and continued brainstorm to construct the project. As a result
				of epidemic, we had to start brainstorm online. It was surprised that we determined our project in April
				10th but still have no solution for starting the experiment. The only thing we could do was searching
				for many literatures to improve the success rate of the experiment. Finally, we came back to school at
				August 23 rd and started our experiment as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>Viewing from the online Giant Jamboree and the CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Community), compared with
				the former Giant Jamboree and the CCiC, we didn’t have the opportunity to communicate with superior
				teams all over the world face to face. And the presentation on line is not as clear as face to face.
				Sometimes, it was influenced by all participants’ Net situations.</p>
			<p>The epidemic also influenced the mentality of all team members sometimes. We were looking forward to
				coming back to campus from February 9th to August 23rd. During that period, we had no choices but to
				encourage each other but still didn’t have the confidence about the experiment part of our project.</p>
			<p>All in all, we have learned a lot this year. We received many useful suggestions about our project on
				modeling, human practice etc. We would like to thank people who helped us and we hope that our
				friendship could keep going on.</p>
