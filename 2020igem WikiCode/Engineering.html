            <p>PhaP contains a hydrophobic granule binding domain and a cytosol-facing hydrophilic domain. Complete
                biodegradable nature of PhaP. PhaP-tagged proteins could interact with various types of hydrophobic
                surfaces. A (Gly4Ser2)2 flexible linker is inserted between PhaP and HD5d5 to facilitate attaching of
                HD5d5 on surface and displaying sufficient flexibility of this peptide.
            </p>
            <p>The noncationic and nonhydrophobic residues of HD5 were replaced with electropositive Arg to increase the
                antibacterial activity of HD5 derivative that contains a Cys2-4 bond, obtaining another derivative
                termed HD5d5. The in vitro antibacterial assay and irradiation-wound-infection animal experiment both
                showed that HD5d5 was much more effective than HD5 at eliminating MDRAb.</p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Method</h1>
            <p>① Positive colonies (E. coli BL21 (DE3) pWDX(+)::PhaP-HD5d5) from September 12, 2020 were transferred to
                test tubes with 2 mL LB+amp and incubated at 37°C, 200 rpm overnight. One 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with
                100 mL LB and 100µL amp/kan was inoculated with 1 mL of one culture above in a 250 mL flask, which both
                were incubated at 37°C, 200 rpm. OD measurement after three hours showed an OD(600) = 0.6. E. coli BL21
                cultures were induced with 100 µL IPTG for incubated at 37°C, 200 rpm overnight.</p>
            <p>The bacterial growth curves at OD600 were recorded at 30-min intervals for 15 hours.</p>

            <p>After induction for 85~6 hours, the sludge was collected by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The
                results showed that the antibacterial peptides fused with PhaP were all expressed, among which PhaP-HD5
                and PhaP-HD5d5 expressed the most.</p>

            <p>② The incubated medium was transferred to 50 mL centrifuge tube and the supernatant collected after
                centrifuging (6791×g) for 3 min at 4°C. After removal of the supernatant by centrifugation (6791×g, 15
                min), it was collected precipitate.</p>
            <p>③ the bacteria were crushed with an ultrasonic (ultrasonic power: 400 W, crushing time: 1 s, interval
                time: 1s) on ice for 2 min. (A volume of 20 ml of the Bacterial lysates was added to each baterial
                precipitat, Bacterial lysates 2.0: 20mM/L tris-HCl 150mM/L NaCl)</p>
            <p>④ PhaP-HD5d5 was not observed in the supernatant analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Research and design cycle</h1>
            <p>Through analysis, the reason we thought was the Bacterial lysates or the ultrasonic power/total time,so
                we change the Bacterial lysates and ultrasonic total time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The bacterias were crushed with an ultrasonic (ultrasonic power: 400 W, crushing time: 1 s, interval
                    time: 1s) on ice for 15 min. (A volume of 20 ml of the Bacterial lysates was added to each baterial
                    precipitat, Bacterial lysates 2.0: 20mM/L tris-HCl 150mM/L NaCl). But PhaP-HD5d5 also was not
                    observed
                    in the supernatant analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</li>
                <li>This time,we increased the power of ultrasound and the time to crush the bacteria,which were
                    crushed with an ultrasonic (ultrasonic power: 500 W, crushing time: 3 s, interval time: 5s) on ice
                    for 30 min.it is pity that we couldn’t observed the PhaP-HD5d5 in in the supernatant analyzed by
                    SDS-PAGE.</li>
                <li>So we increased the total time of ultrasound to 45 min, the bacterias were crushed with an
                    ultrasonic (ultrasonic power: 500 W, crushing time: 3 s, interval time: 5s) on ice for 45 min.The
                    sonicated bacterial lysate was centrifuged 6791 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Equivalent amounts of
                    supernatant and precipitate were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The supernatant, containing target
                    proteins(PhaP-HD5d5)</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Bacteriostatic experiment</h1>
            <p>It was noticed that PhaP-HD5d5 showed the antibacterial effects when examined on S. aureus strain RN4220.
            </p>

            <p>In order to verify the adhesion between PHA and PhaP-AMPs ,we did the following experiments:</p>
            <p>First ,we used electrospinning technology to make PHA films. Secondly the films was immersed in the
                supernatant after bacterial sonication for 2 hours. Thirdly, we washed the films gently with lysis
                buffer, then put them into a centrifuge tube and added SDS-PAGE buffer, heat at 90℃ until the thin
                membrane softens.</p>
            <p>In order to make the adhesion between PhaP-AMPs and PHA better, we used nano-level PHA for verification.
                Added PHA and supernatant in a ratio of 1:20, stirred two hours by the magnetic stirrer, then
                centrifuged at 8000rpm for 2min, rinsed twice with lysate, and added SDS-PAGE buffer.</p>
            <p>We took the liquid from the above product for SDS-PAGE, as we can see, PhaP-HD5d5 combines the most
                products with PHA，whether it is electrospinning or nanoparticles.</p>
