            <p>The purpose of our project is to design a broad-spectrum antibacterial and biodegradable adhesive
                bandage. There are five parts about it:(figure 1)

            <h1 class="sector-title">PhaP-AMP</h1>
            <p>In the process of screening antimicrobial peptides, we preferred to select human antimicrobial peptides
                to reduce the risk of application in the human body. At the same time, in the process of reading the
                literatures, we found a series of synthetic antimicrobial peptides with small molecular weight and
                strong antibacterial activity. Finally, we determined that HD5, HD5d5, HBD3, DCD1L, P5, P6.2 expressed
                in with PhaP.
            </p>
            <p>In the process of verifying the expression of the protein, we found that PhaP-HD5 and PhaP-HD5d5 can be
                stably and efficiently expressed in <span class="inline-italic">E. coli</span> Coincidentally, both of
                them are human defensins (or
                derivatives). Human defensin is one of the antimicrobial peptides, which is harmless to human body. So
                we initially thought that HD5 and HD5d5 are the antimicrobial peptides we wanted.</p>
            <p>We proved that the transformed <span class="inline-italic">E. coli</span> can express PhaP-AMP
                successfully(figure 2), PhaP-HD5 and
                PhaP-HD5d5 are the most expressed complexs among them.
            </p>

            <span class="model-img-label">Figure 2 the expression of PhaP-AMP</span>
            <h1 class="sector-title">PHA</h1>
            <p>In order to verify the adhesion between PHA and PhaP-AMP, we did the adhesion experiment between PHA and
                PhaP. We found that PhaP-HD5d5 combines the most products with PHA，whether it is electrospinning or
                nanoparticles.</p>
            <p>First, we used electrospinning technology to make PHA films. Secondly the films was immersed in the
                supernatant after bacterial sonication for 2 hours. Thirdly, we washed the films gently with lysis
                buffer, then put them into a centrifuge tube and added SDS-PAGE buffer, heat at 90℃ until the thin
                membrane softens.
                In order to make the adhesion between PhaP-AMPs and PHA better, we used nano-level PHA for verification.
                Added PHA and supernatant in a ratio of 1:20, stirred two hours by the magnetic stirrer, then
                centrifuged at 8000rpm for 2min, rinsed twice with lysate, and added SDS-PAGE buffer.
            </p>
            <p>We took the liquid from the above product for SDS-PAGE, as we can see, PhaP-HD5d5 combines the most
                products with PHA，whether it is electrospinning or nanoparticles.</p>

            <span class="model-img-label">Figure 3 Combination of PHA and PhaP-AMP</span>
            <p>Finally, we chose HD5d5 as our target antimicrobial peptide.</p>
            <p>PHAs are considered as one of the most promising "green plastics". Due to the COVID-19, we were unable to
                characterize the biodegradability of PHAs in the laboratory, but by consulting the literature, we
                learned that:PHAs are biodegradable and biocompatible, and can be degraded into H2O and CO2 by many
                microorganisms in the natural environment[1]. The biodegradability of PHAs allows it to be quickly
                decomposed in the natural environment without causing environmental problems. Today, with serious
                medical waste pollution, the biodegradability of PHAs is conducive to environmental protection and is
                also the mainstream direction of future social material development.</p>
            <p>Electrospinning, as the most promising process method for preparing polymer nanofibers, has received
                widespread attention from academia and industry. The nanofiber cloth prepared by electrospinning has a
                porous structure of fibers. Its smaller pore size can block contact between bacteria and wound surface.
                More importantly, the nanofibers prepared by electrospinning technology can structurally mimic the
                extracellar matrix (ECM) secreted by cells and accelerate wound healing. Electrospinning is a very good
                technique for making adhesive bandages.</p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Non-woven fabric</h1>
            <p>During the product planning process, our team discussed the outer materials of the adhesive bandage.
                Non-woven fabric is composed of directional or random fibers. It is called cloth because of its
                appearance and certain properties.
            </p>
            <p>Non-woven fabric has the characteristics of moisture-proof, breathable, flexible, light weight,
                non-combustible, easy to decompose, non-toxic and non-irritating, rich in color, low price, and
                recyclable.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sector-title">Bacterial Mucin</h1>
            <p>PHA is the material for making the central island of adhesive bandage, which has antibacterial activity
                and plays a major bacteriostatic role. The outer layer of the adhesive bandage is non-woven. In order to
                connect the non-woven fabric and PHA, we chose the bacterial mucin. It consists of two types of
                proteins, adhesion protein and cohesive protein. Cohesion protein can be self-assembled into fibers,
                while adhesion protein is responsible for interfacial bonding. The combination of two types proteins
                forms the basis of bioadhesives.
            </p>
            <p>The fibrillar structures of adhesion protein have intrinsic advantages for interfacial underwater
                adhesion. These advantages include tolerance to environmental deterioration, self-healing arising from
                self-polymerization, and large fiber surface areas. [2] So we can use bacterial mucin to connect
                non-woven fabric and PHA, to increase the water resistance of our adhesive bandage.</p>
            <h1 class="sector-title">Glucose starvation suicide switch</h1>
            <p>Glucose starvation activates the catabolic response using cyclic-AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP), one
                of the best-studied TF’s. Low glucose environments cause the cAMP-CRP complex to bind target DNA and
                regulate hundreds of gene targets[3].
            </p>
            <p>We used PT-α crp to control the downstream gene. It is sensitive to glucose starvation. When glucose is
                deficient in the environment, glucose starvation induces the overexpression of autolysin gene in the T-α
                crp promoter(acmA).</p>
