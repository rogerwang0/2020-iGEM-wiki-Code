			<h1 class="sector-title">Overview</h1>
			<p>In iGEM, we are more likely to ignore a fact that our project needs to be used in the real world. As an
				important part, human practice makes our project much more complete and help us test the practicality of
				our project. We believe that the contribution of both experts and consumers makes our product perfect
				and benefits the whole world.
			</p>
			<p>The human practice part of our project consists of thoughts of team members and suggestions of experts.
				Besides, we also have obtained some feedbacks of the public to make sure that our project fits the real
				world. At the same time, we popularized synthetic biology, so that people would have a deeper
				understanding of it. The most important part of our human practice is that we adjust our project
				according to the results of every human practice. adhesive bandage already have a relatively mature
				market now.
				What about the new type of adhesive bandage we pruduced, will it have a market?</p>
			<p>Can we bring it to market? Can it be accepted by consumers? How can we popularize it? Can it survive in
				the severe competitive environment? How can we ensure the advantages of our products in the market? In
				order to make sure that our products can satisfy more people, we decided to seek the advice of people
				from different industries in society, including doctors, professors, drug developers, marketing
				professionals, consumers, students, experts and the public, so as to learn from in their respective
				fields and learn more about how to improve our projects.</p>

			<h1 class="sector-title">PDCA cycle</h1>
			<p>PDCA cycle was first proposed by Walter A. Shewhart, an American quality management expert. He divided
				quality management into plan, do, check and Act. PDCA requires us to make a plan, implement the plan,
				check the effectiveness of the implementation, and then include the successful ones into the criteria,
				and leave the unsuccessful ones to the next cycle to solve. Our project has used this mature framework
				from the start to ensure the smooth progress of our project without missing a single step. Next, we will
				use this framework to explain how our project has been advanced and improved step by step.

			<h1>Training Camp</h1>
			<p>Our training began in November last year, and every member of our team actively participated, opened up
				and gained the corresponding ability in this training camp.</p>
			<p>First of all, our team members have been trained in skills. The members who participated in the previous
				iGEM competitions shared their participation experience and trained our team members to use software and
				improve the ability of searching literature. In addition, our team members have also carried out
				self-study work in their own areas of responsibility, after more than 5 months of training, our team
				members have mastered the use of professional software and the ability to search literature retrieval.
			</p>
			<p>While training, we were also thinking about projects and searching literature. In order to determine our
				project, we met at regular times every week. We shared ideas and brainstormed together through online
				meetings, and we finally determined the project.There were a lot of interesting ideas in the process and
				we learned how to make small ideas possible.</p>
			<p>After the project was determined, all team members collected information, brainstormed and improved the
				project, so that the project was optimized. Winter came as scheduled. A sudden epidemic disrupted
				iGEMer's plans and arrangements. After experiencing difficulties such as not being able to return to
				school, not being able to do experiment, and not being able to hold offline meetings, we were still
				moving forward.</p>

		<div class="text-subsection">
			<h1>Inspiration</h1>
			<p>Our Inspiration comes from two places, the first is our daily life and this has been mentioned on our
				home page. Another point is as follows.As a fire-prone state, wildfire has burned 3.9 millions land in
				California this year, which is the forth
				fire this three years. Across the state, 17,000 firefighters are fighting with nearly 24 fire. Wild
				fires frequently occur in Australia during the hot and dry season. From November 8 last year to February
				13 this year, the fire lasted for four months， which caused at least 33 deaths, mostly are firefighters,
				including many firefighters from other countries. In Liangshan County, Sichuan Province, due to the
				continuous forest fires in the spring of 2019 and 2020, people have endured a lot. To put out the fire,
				we sacrificed 31 firefighters and a large number of personnesl. Fire leads to plenty of loss and
				casualties all around the world annually. Firefighters are easier to get burnt or bruised in their daily
				training or working. The infection is serious if those wounds are not disinfected in time, especially
				under complex environmental conditions. To protect
				our firefighters from lethal bacterial infection, we intend to develop an antibacterial and completely
				biodegradable adhesive bandage.This is our original goal and the inspiration for our project，and we
				really hope that what we have done will help more people.</p>
			<img class="text-img-middle" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/6/6a/T--NWU-CHINA-A--HP-img-20.jpg">
		</div>
		<div class="text-subsection">
			<h1>Interview firefighters</h1>
			<p>We specially interviewed Hang Su, Director of Fire Rescue Detachment Operation Command Center and Mingwei
				Fan, Fire station chief. In the process of talking with them, we know that scraps, scratches, and
				scratches are relatively easy to encounter in their daily life and practical training. When dealing with
				fires or emergency situations in peacetime, burns, stab wounds, scratches and even punctures have
				occurred because of the complicated conditions at the scene. Many situations at work are unavoidable, so
				the wound cannot be treated in time while working. Small wounds are usually treated with adhesive
				bandage for
				about 3-4 days to heal, while large wounds need to be disinfected and then bandaged to heal longer. If
				the wound becomes purulent, it will take more time to heal.</p>
			<p>In special circumstances, when the supplies are not available for earthquake rescue, there are often
				abrasions on feet and shoes, but because the situation is urgent and not handled in time, and the
				environment is relatively harsh, there will be secondary infections. And they also pointed out that
				because of their relatively large amount of adhesive bandage, the adhesive bandage used will not be
				discarded after
				special treatment. Sometimes outings, such as hiking, you'll see some discarded adhesive bandage next to
				the
				supply kit, or some of them will be put on the tree after they are wetted with sweat.</p>
			<p>After we introduced our ideas, Captain Fan and Director Sue of the Fire Brigade expressed great interest
				in our ideas and expressed their willingness to accept this product without sacrificing environmental
				and personal health costs, which should be vigorously promoted and developed. Finally, they also put
				forward some suggestions to our idea ① the economic cost can be lower, so that ordinary people can use,
				enjoy this benefit. ② the size of the dressing and the use of methods can be demonstrated, such as the
				shape of the setting can be more close to the joint, because ordinary creation can be attached to the
				joint using easy to both sides of the wind bacterial infection. ③ High temperature resistance (fire
				field), water resistance (flood disaster) for special industries have a better target. ④ Storage under
				natural conditions does not affect the ability of medicine, easy to carry, comprehensive conditions can
				be better integrated into our lives. From the conversation with them, we learned that the flexibility of
				adhesive bandage is also a factor affecting the sense of use. Better flexibility will not affect the
				festival activities and will not affect daily life and work. The second is waterproof and fit to the
				skin, ordinary adhesive bandage may reduce the viscosity after meeting the water. So it is not suitable
				for people of this particular occupation. We learned from these suggestions and tried to apply them to
				our project.</p>

			<h1>Marketing Research</h1>
			<p>The environmental pollution caused by adhesive bandage and the high-end wound dressings that combine
				adhesive bandage
				and antibacterial functions mentioned by firemen have attracted our attention. After we did some
				investigations about the environmental pollution caused by medical wastes in our lives and as we
				mentioned in our interview that the market conditions for this type of dressing used in our project, we
				made the following summary.</p>
			<h1>Medical waste</h1>
			<img class="text-img-small" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/c/cb/T--NWU-CHINA-A--HP-img-9.png">
			<p>Refers to the direct or indirect infectious, toxic and other hazardous waste produced by medical and
				health institutions in medical treatment, prevention, health care and other related activities.It
				contains a large number of infectious pathogens, the hazard is significantly higher than ordinary
				household garbage,If management is lax or improperly handled, medical waste can easily cause pollution
				to water, soil and air.Can easily become the source of the spread of the virus, cause the spread of the
				epidemic.</p>
			<p>
				Items contaminated by patients’ blood, body fluids and excreta, including: cotton balls, cotton swabs,
				drainage slivers, gauze and various other dressings are all infectious waste in medical waste.Discarded
				general medicines, such as antibiotics, are all medical wastes in medical waste.
			</p>
			<h1>Current status of medical waste treatment</h1>
			<p>With the increase of population and medical institutions and the improvement of medical conditions, the
				amount of medical waste generated is increasing year by year.The damage is more serious and the
				incidence rate increases.And the medical waste generated has increased, such a vicious circle, the
				social losses caused will be immeasurable.</p>
			<img class="text-img-middle" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b3/T--NWU-CHINA-A--HP-img-10.png">
			<p>Among the many medical waste treatment methods currently used internationally, the high-temperature
				incineration treatment method is the first,The reason is that this technology has many advantages, such
				as wide application range, thorough disinfection and sterilization, significant volume reduction effect,
				complete relevant standards and specifications, and mature technology.It has been widely used
				internationally for many years.</p>
			<h1>Defects of incineration technology</h1>
			<p>The main advantage of incineration technology is that the volume and weight are significantly reduced,
				and the waste is obviously destroyed.But its biggest disadvantage is serious air pollution.Prone to
				produce highly toxic substances such as dioxins, polycyclic aromatic compounds, polychlorinated
				biphenyls, and harmful gases such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide, a complete
				exhaust gas purification system needs to be equipped, and the incineration fly ash contains a lot of
				heavy metals; In addition, the cost of incineration is high, and the incinerator needs frequent
				maintenance and has a short service life.</p>
			<h1>Development status of global high-end wound dressing products</h1>
			<img class="text-img-middle" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/3/35/T--NWU-CHINA-A--HP-img-11.png">
			<p>In recent years, the global medical dressing market has basically remained stable. With the increasingly
				problem of global population aging and the resulting increase in patients with ulcers and other
				diseases, the global medical dressing market demand will continue to grow.</p>
			<p>From the perspective of development trends, consumers’ demand for multi-functional, new-material medical
				dressings is becoming increasingly urgent。
			</p>
			<img class="text-img-middle" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e2/T--NWU-CHINA-A--HP-img-12.png">
			<p>
				High-end wound dressings are mainly targeted at wounds that are difficult to heal, take a long time, are
				more painful for patients, and may cause serious complications.High-end wound dressings mainly has the
				advantages of reducing the pain of drug change, shortening the healing time, reducing the number of drug
				changes and so on.</p>
			<p>
				According to BMI Research, the global high-end dressing market reached $5,595 million in 2017 and is
				expected to reach $7,015 million in 2022.The new high-end dressing market has broad prospects and is the
				current trend of industry development.</p>
			<h1>What should we do?</h1>
			<p>The polyhydroxy fatty acid ester (PHA) we use is a new type of degradable material with a very
				special
				degradation method.After use, PHA can be completely degraded into β-hydroxybutyric acid, carbon
				dioxide
				and water in the body.It has its advantages in performance, practicability, degradability and
				safety.
			</p>
			<p>In terms of performance,PHA can meet or exceed the performance of traditional plastics in certain
				specific areas;In terms of practicality,It has application performance and sanitary performance
				similar
				to similar traditional materials;In terms of degradability, after PHA is used, it can be degraded
				quickly in the natural environment, and become a substance and non-toxic gas that are easily used by
				the
				environment, reduce the impact on the environment;In terms of safety, the substances produced or
				remaining in the degradation process aren’t harmful to the environment, will not affect the survival
				of
				humans and other creatures.</p>

		<div class="text-subsection">
			<h1 class="sector-title">Pharmacy research</h1>
			<p>Our team members visited a number of pharmacies in the september this year. Including Tairui Pharmacy,
				Zhongyou Jiankang Pharmacy, Guangji Pharmacy, Taisheng Pharmacy, Boai Pharmacy, Yikang Pharmacy, etc. We
				hope to understand the needs of salesmen and consumers by doing some investigations about the existing
				adhesive bandage on the market, we concluded that:</p>
			<p>Types and sales of band aids investigated:Yunnan Baiyao(Lightweight and breathable type，Waterproof and
				ultra-thin type, Portable type, Anti-inflammatory and hemostatic guaiac type). Band-Aid(Benzalkonium
				chloride band-aid,Waterproof type，Common type). Kaiyan(dedicated combination of fingertips， Slim and
				breathable，Superlarge combination，Waterproof and breathable type).Ruoshu，Zhende，vitastic, etc. It is
				generally reflected that the sales volume of Yunnan Baiyao is relatively good. The first is because
				Yunnan Baiyao is economical, and the second is because of brand factors, customers trust well-known
				brands.</p>
			<img class="text-img-small" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/8/87/T--NWU-CHINA-A--HP-img-13.png">
			<p>Public expectations for future adhesive bandage:Most people's requirements for future adhesive bandage
				are mainly
				reflected in the three aspects of outer packaging, comfort and antibacterial properties.</p>
			<p>①The color of the adhesive bandage should not be too strange for the outer packing, others suggest that
				it would
				be better to make them transparent or sell by classification by skin tone.</p>
			<p>②For comfort, the sticky part and adhesive bandage of the skin is extremely troubling for patients with
				latex
				allergies. In addition, it is also an important demand for consumers to consider both waterproof and
				breathability.</p>
			<p>③As far as bacteriostasis is concerned, most of the bandages on the market lack bacteriostasis
				function.In addition, the impermeability leads to the proliferation of anaerobic bacteria in the wound
				and causes infection. There are still a few people who suggest that adhesive bandage should have
				hemostatic
				function, and that adhesive bandage of different specifications should be designed to meet people's
				needs.</p>
			<p>We also know that the infection of wounds is mainly related to the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria and
				the formation of biofilm on the surface. Sometimes, because of the impermeability or poor adhesion of
				adhesive bandage, it is easy to cause infection. After infection, people mainly choose to apply
				antibiotics to
				wounds. Nowadays, a large number of antibiotics have been studied. As for the shortcomings of
				antibiotics, studies have shown that overuse of antibiotics may lead to antibiotic resistance problems,
				even superbugs. All the pharmacy staff and consumers we interviewed also expressed their understanding
				of the shortcomings of antibiotics, such as its great side effects, allergy to some antibiotics,
				inability to use antibiotics after drinking or patients with poor liver and kidney function, and drug
				resistance caused by taking too much antibiotics. At this time, we turned our attention to antibacterial
				peptide, an antibacterial substance with low systemic toxicity and low drug resistance.</p>

			<h1 class="sector-title">Academic communication with Professor Han</h1>
			<p>In the initial stage, we considered to use six kinds of antimicrobial peptides with their own
				characteristics. Among them, HBD3,HD5,HD5d5,DCD1L is human antimicrobial peptides. ACD (allergic contact
				dermatitis) is a common but complex skin disease. Its common symptoms are local erythema, swelling,
				papules, etc. And if it’s serious, it can spread from the contact around the emergence of toxic
				epidermal necrosis or granulomatous lesions, accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as headache, fever
				and so on. In order to reduce the possibility of ACD caused by allergen contact with wound, our team
				selected human-friendly antimicrobial peptides by searching many literatures and asking teachers in the
				process of selecting antimicrobial peptides. In addition, we also selected two artificially designed
				antimicrobial peptides, P5 and P6.2, which were analyzed by biological software to delete some
				meaningless sequences on the basis of the original antimicrobial peptides and improve their active
				domains to enhance their functions. And we also used the methods of synthetic biology to express and
				verify its antibacterial activity afterward.</p>
			<p>In the middle of our experiment, we encountered some difficulties about our experiment. The
				electrophoretic bands of antimicrobial peptides were very clear but could not be purified. For this
				reason, we specially interviewed Han Jing, a professor in the Chinese Academy of Sciences and she has
				rich experience for this. She analyzed that antimicrobial peptides may exist in the form of inclusion
				bodies and in bacteria in the form of precipitation. It existed very little in the supernatant. But the
				process is very difficult for us, if we need to purify inclusion body protein. So we intended to get as
				much protein as possible to be expressed in the supernatant by adjusting the concentration and time.</p>
			<p>In the later, professor Han suggested that we can make PHA electrospinning to enhance its elasticity
				and air permeability. So it will be more suitable for us as an adhesive bandage material and can be
				affixed to the joint for facilitate movement.</p>

			<h1 class="sector-title">Suicide Switch</h1>
			<p>Considering that our modified Escherichia coli would escape from the laboratory, we wanted to design a
				nutrition-dependent suicide switch to limit the engineering bacteria in the culture medium, so we worked
				with SZPT-CHINA team. The contents are as follows: <a

			<h1 class="sector-title">Questionnaire</h1>
			<p>After the Pharmacy research, we made product improvements according to the needs of the public. in order
				to hear more voices, we combined with our products to do an electronic version of the questionnaire. As
				of October 25, we had received a total of 528 public feedback, and we have put the contents and results
				of the questionnaire at the bottom.</p>
			<p>From the results of the questionnaire, we can draw the conclusion that most people do not know much about
				PHA and antimicrobial peptides, which also urges us to carry out further educational activities.</p>

			<img class="text-img-small" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/9/90/T--NWU-CHINA-A--HP-img-18.png">
			<p>We wanted to know ideas about our project for those who often use adhesive bandage, so we
				specially interviewed four athletes, Haoxuan Zhang , Jiancheng Ge, JiazhiLiu and Chenxi Bo. They said
				that in the course of training, they often have some bruises on their hands, legs or some joints, and a
				large number of adhesive bandage were used. However, the existing adhesive bandage are not very friendly
				to the joint
				wounds and have poor elasticity. It hinders the movement of the joints. In addition, the permeability is
				general, sometimes sweat will soak the adhesive bandage to reduce its stickiness and infection may
				occur. Our
				electrospinning technology can solve this problem very well. With regard to stickiness, although PHA
				itself has a certain degree of adhesion, we still expect to improve its stickiness by expressing
				bacterial mucin, which we will also carry out in the experiment. After listened to our introduction, the
				other was very willing to accept this new type of adhesive bandage and hopes to promote it as soon as
				possible.Their affirmation gave us great encouragement.

			<h1 class="sector-title">Doctor</h1>
			<p>
				We interviewed Dr. Fan. When they encounter a wound contamination, they usually
				bandage the wound with sterile gauze after being treated with iodophor, hydrogen peroxide and alcohol.
				This leads to a problem that if the wound is healed for a long time, the wound will be pulled when the
				gauze is changed and cleaned again, resulting in secondary injury, but it will be susceptible to
				infection if it is not replaced. This will not only lead to longer healing time, increased pain of
				patients, but also produce a large amount of medical waste. If we use our new biodegradable
				bacteriostatic adhesive bandage, we can avoid these two problems, reduce the suffering of patients and
				reduce
				the production of medical waste.
