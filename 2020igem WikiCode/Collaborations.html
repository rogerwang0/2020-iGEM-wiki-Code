                <p>1. Provide participation guidance: NWU-CHINA-B team took part in the competition for the first year.
                    During this competition, our team provides a full range of
                    competition guidance and coordination assistance.</p>
                <p>①In terms of NWU-CHINA-Building, We discussed how to better manage the team and shared the
                    management model of our team with NWU-CHINA-B. As for assigning tasks, let everyone know what they
                    are responsible for and improve work efficiency. We suggested that their team member should report
                    their progress on time. In that way, they can know the progress of each member at the first time;
                    Group chat discussion is convenient for everyone to communicate better. During the construction of
                    their project, we taught them how to do the brainstorm and how to try their best to perfect their
                    project.</p>
                <img class="HP-img1"
                    src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/0/0f/T--NWU-CHINA-A--collaborations-nwu-china-b-1.jpg">
                <p>②In terms of project communication, we held an online Shaanxi iGEM meetup to introduce our project
                    with NWU-CHINA-B, XJTU-China, SZPT-CHINA and HZAU-China. During that meeting, we put forward
                    opinions and suggestions on all teams’ project. We also invited teachers to guide us. This exchange
                    meeting is very meaningful for the next improvement of our projects. In addition, we also held an
                    online meetup with NWU-CHINA-B. In this meetup, we invited two CCiC volunteers named Cheng Li and
                    Zhuolin Liu to discuss the both projects and the existing problems in detail. In that meetup, we
                    understood that the NWU-CHINA-B team project is to improve the water solubility and
                    anti-inflammatory properties of kaempferol through glycosylation. Kaempferol and its glycosylation
                    products have anti-inflammatory and promote wound healing effects. This can be combined with our
                    team’s new anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory bandage, thus we reached a cooperation.
                </p>
                <p>③In the aspect of modeling, we started relevant exchanges with NWU-CHINA-B and XJTU-China. First,
                    each team introduced the model part of each team separately. In addition, we also instructed the
                    modeling team members of NWU-CHINA-B on how to integrate modeling part with experiments and
                    projects.
                </p>

                <p>④In terms of HP, we discussed with NWU-CHINA-B on how to design the questionnaire, and shared the
                    questionnaire with NWU-CHINA-B, provided them with ideas for designing questionnaires, shared with
                    them our team’s HP experience.</p>
                <p>⑤In other aspects, because NWU-CHINA-B is participating in iGEM for the first time, in some
                    competition-related aspects, we also helped them as much as possible. For example, we instructed
                    NWU-CHINA-B on how to apply for reimbursement about the registry fee, how to apply for the use of
                    experimental equipment on campus, how to buy experimental supplies, how to synthesize genes, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>By sharing our experience and providing help to NWU-CHINA-B, they became much more professional and
                    skillful.

                <p>2. Experimental guidance: Our team leader and advisors trained their experiment skills, which
                    includes the use of laboratory equipment and laboratory safety. And we provided them with some
                    materials and instruments needed for their experimental process such as ampicillin,
                    β-mercaptoethanol, shaker, primers, etc.</p>

                <p>XJTU-China and NWU-CHINA-A have conducted communication activities. The two teams have been partners
                    in iGEM for many years. This year we continued to cooperate deeply. We also had extensive exchanges
                    and cooperation in experimental methods, website construction and submission. In terms of
                    experimental methods, we exchanged opinions on cultivating strains, and summarizing the experience
                    and reasons of their failure. As a result, we improved the success rate of following experiments. In
                    terms of webpage, XJTU-China used GitHub and other methods to compile wikis, and established perfect
                    webpage wikis, which inspired us greatly. Therefore, under the cooperation of the two groups, we
                    successfully established our own website wikis.

                <p>Mathematical Modeling cooperation. Our team members had collaborated with XJTU-China team on
                    Mathematical Modeling. The members in charge of the modeling part helped each other find related
                    literature parameter data on growth expression equation, and communicated with modeling approach
                    and experience.</p>

                <p>Shaanxi iGEM Meetup: NWU-CHINA-A XJTU and NWU-CHINA-B talked about the general
                    content
                    of the project and the modeling direction.At the same time discussed and solved the
                    problems in
                    the modeling of each other. XJTU modeling members suggest that cell expression product
                    simulation processes in the NWU-CHINA-A team modeling suggest that probability distributions
                    can
                    be used instead of the assumption that all cells are equalized, making simulations more
                    realistic and credible, and that the Monod equation can be referenced in the expression
                    model.
                    NWU-CHINA-A suggests that the parameters of the suicide switch start mechanism cannot be
                    found
                    in the XJTU team modeling: the corresponding parameters can be fitted first, and then the
                    appropriate starter construction system can be selected from the part library, so that the
                    experimental simulation can optimize the experimental design of the project.</p>

                <p>In CCiC, we learned about each other's projects because the NWU-CHINA-A team's project is related to
                    antimicrobial peptides, while the UESTC-software team's project was an analysis of the protein
                    domain, we are very interested in their project. The UESTC-Software team accepted and agreed to the
                    NWU-CHINA-A team's request for cooperation. And in a later online meeting, they shew their
                    3D-printed protein domain model and shared their project progress. After that, they asked us to help
                    test the designed game. In a meetup, we are proposed to design a map of the protein domain for
                    UESTC-Software. As a return, they designed a badge diagram for the NWU-CHINA-A team with project
                    features. During the upcoming month of wiki freeze, we both communicated with each other. At the end
                    of iGEM, the project collaboration between the two teams will continue, and we believe that with the
                    help of Software, the antimicrobial peptide experiments of the NWU-CHINA-A team will be more
                    successful, and the UESTC-Software team will have a broader field of protein domain analysis.</p>

                    and Jinan Foreign Language School team established a friendship, and we often keep in touch. This
                    summer, they had trouble in doing overlapping PCR. Being college students, we have more theory and
                    experience than high school students. Based on our knowledge and experience, we mentored them
                    overcoming the technical difficulty. Finally, they completed successfully the overlapping PCR.</p>

                <p>Both Beijing_4ELEVEN and our team hope to solve the problem of antibiotic resistance by using
                    antimicrobial peptides, and both of our project involve materials that can stick to the surface of
                    the skin. We saw great potential for cooperation. We communicated about the experiment, they found
                    that bacterial mucin may be of great significance to our project, so they suggested us to look for
                    Greatbay_SCIE2019 project. Then we checked the literature of bacterial mucin and supplemented our
                    project.</p>

                <p>Both of our teams have used antibacterial peptides, and there is overlap in the selection of
                    antibacterial peptides. We have done a lot of communication about this. We communicated with each
                    other about the progress of the experiment. In terms of protein purification, we encountered the
                    problem that the protein could not be purified and the concentration of the purified protein was too
                    low, so they recommended us to use the ultrafiltration centrifuge tube for protein purification and
                    concentration. Then we took their advice and we made great progress in our experiment. Our two
                    schools also jointly organized lectures to promote synthetic biology and antimicrobial peptides.</p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Troubleshoot a project</h1>
            <p>At the beginning of the project, we encountered difficulties in the selection of antimicrobial peptides.
                There are nearly 3000 kinds of antibacterial peptides, besides there are also existed some artificially
                modified antibacterial peptides. Thus, it’s quite difficult for us to select appropriate antimicrobial
                peptides among such a wide range.</p>
            <p>Ms. Han suggested that we should consider what kind of bacteria we want to kill first, whether it’s
                broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum. After that, the next thing we need to pay attention to is that we
                should select peptides with strong antibacterial activity. And if we are going to use these peptides on
                the surface of a wound, we also need to make sure that the antimicrobial peptide is not harmful to
                normal cells. And the last point, whether this antibacterial peptide can be expressed by synthetic
                biology and whether it is easy to express should have been verified by experiments before. According to
                these suggestions, we consulted the literature and selected six eligible antibacterial peptides.</p>
            <p>We intend to make a breakthrough in the selection of antibacterial peptides that we hope to synthesize an
                artificially designed antibacterial peptide which has not been expressed by synthetic biology before.

            <h3>The 4th Southern China Regional Online Meeting</h3>
            <p>In 2020 June , our team was fortunate to participated in the 4th Southern China Regional Online Meeting
                held by the Shenzhen University iGEM team. Ambassador Zhang Nan of After iGEM explained us about how
                social practice activities under the epidemic should be carried out to explore the meaning and direction
                of our project. In the meantime , several experts also expressed their views and suggestions on the
                development of this year’s iGEM project. After that , each school team carried out the project
                presentation. Then the teachers , experts and the students present on the meetup commented and asked
                questions about these projects. We also actively participated in the free discussion part after the
                meeting and exchanged academic ideas with other teams. Ambassador Zhang Nan emphasized that when
                communicating with all sectors of society , it is very important to continuously reflect on one’s own
                projects, to have a sense of responsibility to the society , and to tolerate and think about different
                perspectives. These suggestions provide new ideas for our Human Practice.

            <p>Eastern China iGEM Meetup was co-sponsored by the Jilin_China and the Jiangnan_China, the meetup was
                attended by a large number of teams. Many teachers also attended the meeting, including iGEM Asian
                Ambassador Jiabao Li.</p>
            <p>During the exchange meeting, a question raised by a team attracted our attention: Will the technology you
                developed in your project be abused? This question has inspired us that we could and we should develop
                our project into high-end medical products, instead of low-tech and low-level manufacturing. For
                example, from band-aid to medical dressing and then to the carrier of drugs for treating cancer. Anyway,
                if this technology is widely used, it will do more good than harm.</p>

            <h3>The 7th Conference of China iGEMer Meetup</h3>
            <p>The theme of this conference is “from LAB to FAB”, from Laboratory to Fabrication, which means turn
                science and technology achievements into effective productivity so that synthetic biology can truly
                participate in life and change the world. This five-day conference includes opening ceremonies, academic
                lectures, team presentations, poster presentations, workshop, team discussions, closing ceremonies, and
                so on.</p>
            <p>Before the conference, we made clear division and actively prepared the relevant materials for the
                meeting. During the conference, through discussions with teachers and other teams, we realized
                advantages of other teams and shortcomings of our projects. </p>
            <p>In the future, we will further strengthen cooperation and exchanges, and at the same time promote public
                education and experiments to make our project better. Furthermore, all the participating teams formed a
                large group for communication and solving various problems. We also met our future partners in this
                meeting, UESTC-Software and Beijing_4ELEVEN.</p>
            <h3>Friend Team Meetup</h3>
            <p>Our Team was invited to participate Friend Team Meetup sponsored by SZPT-CHINA. In this meetup，we met
                more teams who would like to do antibacterial peptide productions and we communicated the problem about
                antibacterial peptide selection and design of experiment. Many teams gave us advices，one of them caused
                our attention.The team suggested that we should be more cautious on the wound production. If we purify
                peptide with a nickel column alone, the purity is not up to the medical standard. We thought this is an
                important issue, and if we want to get our product into the market, we will explore higher standard
                purification methods.</p>

            <h3>Shaanxi iGEM Meetup</h3>
            <p>The first Shaanxi iGEM Meetup was hosted by our team online and we invited all the teams who participated
                in the iGEM competition in Shaanxi to attend the meetup. During the meetup, we exchanged views, learned
                from each other in the project presentation and discussion sessions, helped each other, shared
                experiences and methods, put forward many feasible proposals, and reached follow-up cooperation.</p>

            <p>After reading our model, the XJTU-China team thought that the picture from the model simulation could be
                added below to make the modeling clearer. And we also asked the XJTU for modeling reference. After a
                series of exchanges, we have benefited a lot. And we keep in touch throughout the whole preparing
                period.</p>
