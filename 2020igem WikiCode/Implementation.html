            <p>We proved that the transformed E. coli can express PhaP-AMP successfully(figure 1), PhaP-HD5 and
                PhaP-HD5d5 are the most expressed complexs among them.

            <span class=".model-img-label">Figure 1 the expression of PhaP-AMP</span>
            <p>In order to verify the adhesion between PHA and PhaP-AMPs ,we did the following experiments:</p>
            <p>First, we used electrospinning technology to make PHA films. Secondly the films was immersed in the
                supernatant after bacterial sonication for 2 hours. Thirdly, we washed the films gently with lysis
                buffer, then put them into a centrifuge tube and added SDS-PAGE buffer, heat at 90℃ until the thin
                membrane softens.</p>
            <p>In order to make the adhesion between PhaP-AMPs and PHA better, we used nano-level PHA for verification.
                Added PHA and supernatant in a ratio of 1:20, stirred two hours by the magnetic stirrer, then
                centrifuged at 8000rpm for 2min, rinsed twice with lysate, and added SDS-PAGE buffer.</p>
            <p>We took the liquid from the above product for SDS-PAGE, as we can see, PhaP-HD5d5 combines the most
                products with PHA，whether it is electrospinning or nanoparticles.</p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Electrospinning</h1>
            <P>Electrospinning, as the most promising process method for preparing polymer nanofibers, has received
                widespread attention from academia and industry. The nanofiber cloth prepared by electrospinning has a
                porous structure of fibers. Its smaller pore size can block contact between bacteria and wound surface.
                More importantly, the nanofibers prepared by electrospinning technology can structurally mimic the
                extracellar matrix (ECM) secreted by cells and accelerate wound healing. Electrospinning is a very good
                technique for making adhesive bandages.</P>

            <p>At this stage, we have made shaped adhesive bandages using electrospinning technology. In the experiment,
                we proved that PHA electrospun films can be combined with PhaP-HD5d5 tightly (figure 2).</p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Nanoparticles</h1>
            <P>Controlled drug release is the most convenient way of drug delivery currently, and the use of
                nano-particles has received special attention in the past two decades. Controlled drug delivery (CDD)
                technology is one of the most prominent fields in the field of human health science.

            </P>
            <P>
                Polyesters have been widely used in drug delivery because of their biodegradability and adjustable
                mechanical properties. Polyesters have been used in various delivery systems for low molecular weight
                drugs as well as peptide and protein drugs. Most of the nano-particles based on polyester are focused on
                tumor-targeted drug delivery. Nano-particles made from polyester materials include microspheres,
                capsules, cubes and other shapes, and the active drug component (API) is usually uniformly dispersed in
                the polyester matrix[1].</P>
            <P>
                Nano-particles are partly internalized by liquid phase endocytosis and grid protein-mediated
                endocytosis. Within 10 minutes after incubation, they quickly escape lysosomes and enter the cytoplasm,
                and nano-particles can effectively incorporate drugs into their structures[2]. Compared with large
                particles with small surface area, microns and nano-particles with large surface volume ratio can
                provide more reaction sites, so PHA nanoparticles can better combine with PhaP, thus carrying more AMP.
                Because the concentration of AMP is positively related to the antibacterial effect, the use of PHA
                nano-particles can have a better antibacterial effect.</P>
            <P>
                We may express and use PHA nano-particles by cell administration in the future. Through the genetic
                engineering of the cells, the engineered cells can be targeted to specific infection sites in the body
                for targeted drug administration. Because the intestinal tract has a special mechanism for absorbing
                particles of a specific size, nano-particles are considered to be one of the best ways to absorb
                particles from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. And because of the sustained
                release effect of cell administration, we can keep the concentration of PhaP-AMP at a certain level
                without worrying about the inhibitory effect of excessive high concentration on surrounding normal
                tissue and low concentration on invasive bacteria.</P>
            <h1 class="sector-title">Patent</h1>
            <P>While conducting the project feasibility test in the laboratory, we are also working hard to gain market
                recognition. At present, the patent of our project is under application and has been professionally
                recognized(figure 4).</P>
            <img class="text-img-middle" src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/0/00/T--NWU-CHINA-A--patent.png">
            <span class=".model-img-label">Figure 4 the payment notice for patent</span>
            <P>In order to implement our project from the laboratory to the real world, we have the following plans</P>
            <P>1. As far as the product itself is concerned, the choice and the safety of raw materials are very
                important, such as whether GMO strains are legal and whether there are corresponding national
                regulations; It is necessary to consider the realizability of the design scheme, the application data of
                the product and the development plan of the follow-up product.</P>
            <P>2. As far as production is concerned, special raw materials should be bound with exclusive authorization
                as much as possible; In the choice of the foundry factory, we should pay attention to the
                confidentiality of the formula and the constraints on the foundry factory, and the final cost should be
                calculated carefully. </P>
            <P>3. As far as documents are concerned, the project involves patents and trademarks, production licenses
                and approvals, etc., which should be planned from the beginning.
            </P>
            <P>
                4. In terms of marketing, the concept of this product is environmentally friendly and novel, so
                marketing is very important. After the completion of the market positioning, if the production cost is
                positioned at the high-end products, you can use your own advantages to publicize them.</P>
            <P>After listening to our plan, Li Yang, the manager of Coway International TechTrans Co.,Ltd., expressed
                her agreement, and added that it is not difficult to turn this project into a product. The most basic
                thing is the funds and the team. We already have the team. A clear division of labor and the expansion
                of their respective fields are more important and the capital actually does not require large-scale
                capital at the beginning, and small capital can also start this project.</P>
