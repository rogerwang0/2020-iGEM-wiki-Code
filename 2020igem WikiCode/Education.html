            <h1 class="sector-title">Social survey</h1>
            <p>We collected 528 feedbacks on our project from people with different academic qualifications and
                industries, through the questionnaire survey. (The specific results are shown in: <a
                    href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:NWU-CHINA-A/Human_Practices">https://2020.igem.org/Team:NWU-CHINA-A
                    /Human_Practices</a>) We also visited a number of pharmacy to explore the antimicrobial
                peptide
                hidden in them.According to the data we got, only 15.9% of the public knew about antimicrobial peptide,
                47.9% had only heard of the name, and 36.2% had never heard of it. And for PhaP, more than half of the
                people said that they had no idea. It can be seen that the public knows little about antimicrobial
                peptide and PhaP. So we planned to use this as an incision to bring a colorful world of synthetic
                biology to the public.

            <h1 class="sector-title">Broadcast</h1>
            <p>On the radio station of Northwestern University in China, we introduced our project and what prompted us
                to study this problem and find solutions. Finally we shared our experiences and feelings about
                participating in the iGEM competition. </p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Internet publication</h1>
            <p>We have updated a number of popular science articles on synthetic biology at the same time on our
                official Wechat account and our official bilibili account. For readers interested in synthetic biology,
                the technology and latest advances in synthetic biology are popularized with pictures and texts. At the
                same time, we have also uploaded videos of the whole process of our communication with people from
                various industries on our bilibili account, so that we can find some solutions to our problems when we
                look back in the future. </p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Lecture</h1>
            <p>On October 17, SZPT-CHINA Team invited our principle investigator, Dr. Wei and students of our team to
                give a lecture on synthetic biology for students at SZPT University. We mainly introduced synthetic
                biology and told them the history of synthetic biology development in the aspects of artificial cells,
                cell reconstruction, study of protein chemistry and the development of nucleic acid chemical synthesis.
                We also focused on antimicrobial peptide and how to produce antimicrobial peptide by means of synthetic
                biology. The lecture went well and was greeted enthusiastically by students.</p>

            <h1 class="sector-title">Propaganda and brochures</h1>
            <p>We introduced iGEM and synthetic biology to freshmen from the College of Life Sciences at Northwestern
                University and showed them our project. In the presentation, they showed great interest in what we said
                and expressed their desire to join our team. During the question session, they asked a lot of questions
                about synthetic biology, and our team answered them one by one, and encouraged them to follow and
                participate in iGEM continuously. We believe that our team is growing day by day!</p>
