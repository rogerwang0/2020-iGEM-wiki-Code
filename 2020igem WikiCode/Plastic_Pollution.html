            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Another important aim of our project is to address the environmental pollution caused by antibiotics and
                plastics. Synthetic biology provides a very useful solution to various environmental pollution problems
                encountered in ecology. Such as the use of synthetic biology strains to solve the problem of oil spills
                and the production of clean new energy. Our project also adopts this idea, we use synthetic biology
                method to transform bacterial strains to produce antimicrobial peptides, so as to solve the ecological
                environmental pollution problems caused by the plastic part of band-aids and antibiotics. Next, we will
                describe in detail the current situation of environmental pollution, which is an important driving force
                for our project.

            <h1 class="sector-title">1. Plastic pollution</h1>
            <p>Evidence abounds for plastics' potential to pollute and disrupt important natural processes and quality
                of life. Plastic fragments, varying in size from macrodebris (bigger 20 mm), to mesodebris (2–20 mm), to
                microdebris (smaller than 2 mm) are polluting the world's oceans. Using surface net tows, 334,000
                plastic items were
                collected in 1999 per square kilometer in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, a mass equivalent to
                5.1 kg.The amount of anthropogenic litter in aquatic and terrestrial environments has increased
                dramatically over the last few decades; approximately 60e80% of which is plastic. Mass production of
                plastics began in the 1950s, and currently exceeds 280 million tones globally. It is estimated that
                4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons of mismanaged plastic waste enters the oceans from coastal countries
                each year. When introduced into natural environments, plastics can be transported from land to
                river, and eventually reach the ocean. During the migration, plas-tics can lead to detrimental
                impacts on natural surround-ings, wildlife, and even human health. Meanwhile, plastics could act as
                vectors for persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, microorganisms in the environment.

            <h1 class="sector-title">3. Plastic Pollution is Persistent</h1>
            <p>However, it likely takes much longer time for plastics to degrade in
                the environment owing to the high-polymer nature when
                compared to other organic materials.

        <div class="text-subsection">
            <h1 class="sector-title">4. Plastic Pollution is a Global Issue</h1>
            <p>Plastics can not only directly enter the aquatic, atmospheric, and terrestrial systems through diverse
                pathways, but also migrate freely among these various systems. Here, we propose the “plastic cycle”,
                which likely takes place in the environment, similar to well-known carbon or nitrogen cycle in the
                environment. Specially, plastic cycle is the process of plastics to migrate among water, atmosphere and
                soil through different pathways. For example, light plastics are more easily transported in different
                systems with the action of various forces, leading to the spread of plastics to some remote areas in the
                environment. Studies have demonstrated the presence of plastics in uninhabited areas, such as pristine
                mountain catchment, polar regions, and deep sea . Consequently, plas-tic pollution is a global issue
                with no boundaries in the world owing to the long-distance transport in different systems.

            <h1 class="sector-title">6. Future issues</h1>
            <p>Whereas plastics are an essential part of modern society, emerging human health effects and documented
                ecological impacts demand the development of smarter and safer materials for future use.Nearly 30% of
                plastic waste is still landfilled in Europe, and the current EU plan is to reduce landfilling of plastic
                to no more than 10% by 2030. In the USA, 53% of total municipal solid waste (MSW) is landfilled, with
                plastic waste representing 13% of MSW. The recycling rate of nondegradable plastic remains stubbornly
                low globally. While recycling technologies are available, the high price and relatively low quality of
                the recycled plastic limits market applications. Biodegradable plastic are especially interesting for
                nondurable applications such as packaging and agricultural films where biodegradability offers new
                end-of-life management options not open to nondegradable plastic, e.g., composting and anaerobic
                degradation. Biodegradability is an advantage when inadvertent environmental release occurs to aquatic
                and terrestrial environments.
            </p>
            <p>These are our thoughts on environmental pollution in ecology, and our project is also a solution to
                environmental pollution in ecology through the thinking of synthetic biology.We also hope that our
                project will convey this way of thinking to future iGEMers.
